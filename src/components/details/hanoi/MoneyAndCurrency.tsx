      Money And Currency Details
    </h2>
    <p>
      The official currency of Vietnam is the Vietnamese Dong (VND). As of
      12/29/2024, the exchange rate is $1 USD â‰ˆ 25,000 VND. VND paper notes come
      in polymer (VND 10,000 to 500,000) and cotton (VND 1,000 to 5,000).
      Amounts over VND 15,000,000 or $5,000 USD or equivalent must be declared
      upon arrival or exit.
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>
      Although most payments are made in VND, US dollars are accepted in some
      hotels and restaurants but at unfavorable rates. Currency exchange is easy
      for major currencies, particularly USD, at banks, airports, and exchange
      stalls. Recommended banks include Vietcombank, HSBC, and BIDV. ATMs are
      available 24/7, with withdrawal limits around VND 2-4 million and fees
      starting at VND 30,000.

    <p>
      For payments, cash is preferred in small shops, while cards
      (Visa/Mastercard/Amex) are widely accepted in large stores and
      restaurants. Digital wallets like MoMo and mobile payments (Apple Pay,
      Google Pay) are increasingly popular. Always carry backup cash or a card
      for emergencies, as some places may not accept digital payments.

    <p>
      Tipping is appreciated but not required, and sales tax is included in
      prices.
