    often use “k” to denote thousands. Paper notes include: Polymers material:
    VND 500,000 (~19.6 USD); 200,000 (~7.86 USD); 100,000 (~3.93 USD); 50,000
    (~1.96 USD); 20,000 (~0.79 USD); 10,000 (~0.39 USD) Cotton material: VND
    5,000; 2,000; 1,000 According to the law, Vietnamese Dong in excess of VND
    15,000,000 or foreign currency in excess of 5,000 USD or equivalent in other
    currencies must be declared upon arrival or exit. Most payments are made in
    VND but US dollars can be directly used for some hotels, restaurants, tours
    or other services. However, it is not recommended to pay with US dollars
    instead of VND, because they will be converted at a lower exchange rate and
    you will end up paying more Most major currencies can be changed in Vietnam.
    US Dollars to VND can be easily changed in banks, hotels, airport exchange
    stalls, and jewelry stores. Other currencies can be changed in banks. Banks:
    Go to major banks around the city to change money. Some of the recommended
    banks are Vietcombank, Agribank, HSBC, BIDV, Vietin Bank, Techcombank,
    VPBank, SHB, Sacombank, ACB, TPBank, MBBank. It í a slow process, and you’ll
    be charged a commission rate between 0.5% to 2%. If your notes are dirty or
    damaged, you will be charged an additional 2% of the note’s values. You need
    to fill out the form and bring your passport to exchange money Airports: You
    will find some currency exchange stalls when arriving at the airport of
    Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. However, the exchange rate is unfavorable here.

    to town for a better rate. Tips on exchanging money: Don’t change too much
    money at one time Don’t accept any damaged notes from others as it will be
    hard for you to use them again Check the polymer material, hidden image
