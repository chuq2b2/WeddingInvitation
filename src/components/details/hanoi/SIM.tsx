      Wi-Fi is widely available in Vietnam, but a SIM card is essential for
      connectivity. You can buy a SIM card with various data plans ($5-30) at
      airports, kiosks, or stores. Note that the SIM may not work with locked
      phones. Visit Thegioididong or Viettel stores for help with installation.
      Check your international roaming plan, as it can be expensive.
